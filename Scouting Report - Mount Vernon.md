Spartronics Scouting Process, 2016
==================================

## Intro

Scouting for alliance selection has been a pretty hair-tearing-out process in
the past.  Nobody likes staying up until midnight sorting through papers trying
to extract some meaningful data, yet that was what had to happen.  The aim of
the scouting papers and data analysis this year is to assist scouters in
collecting and looking through the information collected about other teams,
efficiently.

## Day 0: Before a Competition

Six lead scouters are assigned at the meeting before a competition.  Any
suggested changes to the scouting sheets are made, and (12 / 2) * (# teams at
event) + 10 sheets are printed.  A script is also run which generates a
spreadsheet customized for this event, based on data pulled from The Blue
Alliance.

## Day 1: Qualification Match Scouting

The sheets themselves have boxes to put in the team number, match number, number
of points scored, information on what defenses the team can cross, etc. There's
also boxes for qualitative data like "how much work did this team do" and "other
comments".

They're given a clipboard labeled R1, R2, R3, B1, B2, or B3.  These correspond
to alliance stations on the red or blue side, numbered 1--3.  Clipboards, and
the people using them, don't have assigned teams.  They scout whatever team is
in their slot at the time.  Clipboards have a stack of these sheets (printed
2-up).  Once both halves are filled out, they're given to someone to record the
information in the pregenerated spreadsheet.

Back at the hotel, the lead scouts, team captains, some mentors, and anyone
else involved gathers to discuss team rankings.  Using a combination of the
scouting spreadsheet data, The Blue Alliance team rankings, and background
knowledge, lists are created.  Disregarding the top six alliance captains,
unless we're one of them, we sort the remaining teams into three categories --
"definitely pick", "maybe pick", and "never pick".  These lists are then sorted
by preference, so that when a team on our list is picked, we can cross it off
and move down the list to find the next best match.

## Day 2: Decision Making

Scouting continues even after making the three lists.  Usually there are more
qualification matches than fit in one day.  Based on our observations -- mostly
qualitative at this point -- we rearrange teams on the list until the very last
match.  The final list is written down and given to the driveteam coach to bring
to the alliance selection stage.

We bring the information regardless if we're selecting in the first round,
because the data we gather can still be used by the alliance that picks us to
help find a third alliance member.

## Does it Work?

We think the data gathered is really useful in identifying who would work well
with us.  As far as the scouting process, the response of the scouts have been
overwhelmingly positive.  Overall this was a great improvement over the previous
scouting processes.

## Previous Method

The last version of this process was pretty different for the scouts in the
stands.  We had a hanging file folder box and one labeled folder for every team
at the event.  The lead scout would find a blank sheet, label it with the team
number, and give it to the scout with the clipboard associated with the team's
current position in the alliance station.  After one match, the lead scout takes
all the filled out sheets and files them back in to the right folder.  This was
overall a bad decision.

We bought the folders intending to improve organization of the papers. It
succeeded, but wasn't at all worth the effort.  Since the information on the
sheets was being (almost) immediately entered into a spreadsheet, there's
actually very little necessity to keep track of the files so meticulously.
Storing and retreiving six sheets from six folders every single match takes an
incredible amount of time.

Everyone involved prefers the current method to this file folder system.

## Hindsight

The scouting sheet itself places a bit too much emphasis on qualitative things
like how much work a team did.  Reorganizing the sheet to have dedicated places
for numerical data like the number of times they crossed a defense and moving
the qualitative parts into the combined "other comments" box would make
analysis easier.  The sheet also neglects a tally of how many times a
particular defense was crossed, only tracking how many times they crossed any
defense (and which defenses were easy to cross).  Confusion arose when people
were unsure whether to track only neutral zone to courtyard crossings or
include the reverse in their tallies.

The hanging file folder has been obsoleted by Ruby and spreadsheets.  It's now
a bit of a waste to try and use it.  Recycling the file folders, minus three --
blank, inbox, and processed -- is probably what we'll do.
